                    Hello Everyone, today I will be rating some of my favorite and very popular TV shows, as well as, popular streaming services. To start we have Cobra Kai. This is a TV show that is on Netflix and is a spin-off from the original Karate Kid Movies. The show is really cool because the show uses the same actors to play the roles they played 30+ years ago. Furthermore, the show has the perfect mixture between drama and action. I rate this show a 8.5/10. The next show we have is Loki. This show is on Disneyplus. It has massive correlation to the Marvel universe and the past Marvel movies. It comes directly after a scene from Avengers Endgame, which is pretty cool. Furthermore, the plot and intensity is amazing. In my opinion this was the best show Disneyplus released on their streaming service and that says alot because they dropped a ton of good shows. With that I rate Loki a 9/10. Next we have Invincible. This show is on Amazon Prime Video. It's a cartoon that is about superheros. The show is mixed with comedy, drama, and tons of action. Furthermore, the show is like a DC parody giving their heros similar powers to the Justice league. As I got older I stopped watching cartoons and didn't really enjoy it as much as I did wehn I was a kid, but this show is different. It was amazing and I assure you it is no childish cartoon. I rate this show a 8.7/10. The next show we have is Ted Lasso. This show is on Apple TV. This is about an American college football coach coming to coach professional English Football. The character development is unmatched and the plot of the show is just amazing. The show has a particular kind of humor, so I think this show might not be for everyone, but I found the show to be really good and funny. I don't watch English Football or even like it, but this show taught me a lot about not only English Football, but also culture over there. Furthemore, the show has really got me interested in the sport. I would rate this show a 8/10. The last show I will be rating is One Tree Hill. This show can be found on Hulu. The show is amazing, it starts slowing down after they graduate high school and to be honest I didn't even watch the last season. But, the show is amazing with the good storylines and character development. There is just something about it that makes it so entertaining and fun to watch. Ultimately, I would rate this show 8.3/10. Thank you for reading this portion of the Blog, now continue down to my thoughts on the various streaming services.  <br /><br /> </p>

                    I hope you enjoyed my thoughts on some popular TV Shows I've recently watched. Now, I will be discussing some popular streaming services I use and the good shows I reccomend. First, there is Netflix. This is pretty affordable and you can actually get it paid for by T-Mobile if you get a plan with them. Netflix has a ton of variety when it coems to shows and movies. The platform is easy to use. Furthermore, netflix has exclusive movies and shows that have been very popular, such as Squid Games, Stranger Things, Cobra Kai, 13 Reasons Why,Too All the Boys I've Loved Before, etc. If you have a subscription or think about getting one I would reccommend Manifest, All American, Lucifer, Grey's Anatomy, Blacklist, Criminal Minds, Ozark, and more. There are really too many shows to list right now, but I'm telling you the Netflix subscription is worth it. Next we have Disneyplus, their subscription is a bit cheaper than Netflix, but you also have the option to bundle DisneyPlus, Hulu, and Espn+ for like $15 dollars (I did this). It has all the Disney shows you watched as a kid, so you can rewatch them for nostalgia. Plus, this platform ranges from Pixar to Marvel to Star Wars. Disneyplus too has their own exclusive shows that have become some of the most watched shows in 2021, such as Loki, WandaVision, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, etc. The only downside is that they don't have the Spiderman movies because they co-own that with Sony. The platform caters to just about anyone with their variety of shows and movies, as it has old diney shows and star war movies that caters to the older generation. It also has shows to cater tothe young children and then there's the perfect mixture for the people in their teen years to their 40s. Overall, the platform in my opinion is not as good as Netflix, but I'd say that it is definitely one to subscribe to every now and then just to watch the latest tv series that they drop and if you want to watch any Marvel or Star Wars movies. Next we have Amazon Prime Video, this subscription is included if you have Amazon Prime, which just about everyone does given how large and popular Amazon has become over the years. I'd say Amazon Prime is a little more limited with their movies and shows, but I will say that they do have some really good tv shows, such as Suits, Invincible, and The Boys. These are three TV shows that I loved and are definitely in my top 10. I highly reccommend watching these shows. Every now and then they have some really good movies to watch, but it's a less variety than the other platforms. Next we have Apple TV, whose service is by far the worst out of the ones I will be talking about. They have a very limited variety of shows and movies, which is why their subscription is the cheapest at $5 dollars per month. Even though they lack variety, they have produced amazing Apple TV exclusive shows, such as Ted Lasso and The Morning Show. It almost makes up for their lack of variety, I highly reccommend these shows. Finally, I will be talking about Hulu, who has a great mixture between movies and TV shows. Although it doesn't have as many popular Hulu exclusive shows, the thing that seperates itself from the rest is that it gives you to have live TV+Hulu for around $65 dollars. On the platform you can watch almost about anything as it has a ton of variety of movies and shows. Unlike Disney, they have spiderman movies on their platform. I think Hulu might be better than Netflix just because it has more popular and good movies and tv shows, but Netflix has more up to date and exclusive shows. Thank you for reading my opinion on streaming services and I hope you join us next week for popular movies and what I think of it.  </p>
